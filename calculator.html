            <h3>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <hr />
        <p>This is a simple group project that me and my friends made for our final grade when we were in first year of college, 1st semester. My contribution to the project is a simple calculator. I included some input validation in the code so that the program doesn't accept anything non-numerical.</p>
